A live preview of the site is located here: https://jtphillips215.github.io/foreverly-landing/

This is a mock landing site made in vanilla HTML and CSS for a friend's business. At the time, they were considering leaving Etsy and having their own webpage and store front created. I made mockup so that they would have an idea how a complete site could look and work for them. As this was a mock up, most links and  buttons do not work by design.
